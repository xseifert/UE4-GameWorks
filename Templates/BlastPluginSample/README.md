Blast UE4 Sample Project
================

Blast UE4 plugin sample project. Compile UE4, open this project, hit _Play_, shoot the balls at different destructible objects present in the scene.

This project is very simple. It was created from _First Person Template_ with _Starter Content_ by fracturing different assets right from UE4 with [Blast Mesh Editor](../Engine/Plugins/GameWorks/Blast/Documentation/BlastMeshEditor.md), placing them in the scene and tweaking parameters.
